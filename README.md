## Hi there 👋, I'm Yap Zong Xin
I'm a final-year Computer Science student at NUS with a passion for building intuitive and visually engaging interfaces that enhance user experiences.
When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me riding around the city on my motorcycle 🛵 or hunting for great food 🍔 (or thinking about what to eat next 🤔).

### 👁️ Seeking Internships
I'm looking for a **3-month internship** from **May 2025 to August 2025** during my summer break. I'm eager to learn anything and everything, whether it's new technologies, best practices, or just the art of making the perfect cup of coffee ☕.

### 🌱 Recent Projects

💻 Computing: ReactJS, NodeJS, JavaScript, MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase, Supabase, Git, Docker, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap <br />
