## Hi there 👋, I'm Yap Zong Xin
I'm a recent Computer Science graduate at NUS with a passion for building intuitive features and designing user‑centric products that solve real problems.
When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me riding around the city on my motorcycle 🛵 or tinkering with random visual designs and layouts for fun 🎨 - like making stickers for my motorcycle trips or just for whatever inspires me.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
💻 Computing: ReactJS, NodeJS, ASP.NET, JavaScript, Python, MongoDB, MySQL, SSMS, Firebase, Supabase, Git, Docker, Angular, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap <br />
🎨 Designing: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe XD, Figma, UI/UX, Canva

### 🧪 Currently Working On
I'm building a Road Trip Planner — a web app that makes planning and joining road trips effortless. Users can create custom routes by adding stops like restaurants, hotels, and attractions, all connected seamlessly on an interactive map 🗺️. Whether you're a solo traveler mapping out your next journey or joining a group adventure, this app ensures a smooth and flexible road trip experience. [Stay tuned for updates!](https://github.com/yap-zong-xin/road-trip/blob/main/README.md) ✨
